# Castagne
Castagne allows you to make fighting games more easily. It is a layer built upon Godot that manages the internal logic needed, so that you can focus on making the game itself.
It focuses on:
- Efficiency: Iterate quickly and frequently. Works online directly. Learn from within the engine.
- Flexibility: Adapt to several genres, and weirder experiments. Can extend easily.
- Tools: Strong tools to help drive development. Make changes safely and in an informed way.

# Current Status : Castagne v0.53.1
v0.53.1 is, in my opinion, good enough to make your core gameplay in. It's got most things I've needed up to now, with more coming. Interface has stabilized.

The project is overall stable, but still a bit incomplete. Some small changes in behaviour may still happen as potential bugs are fixed.
Rollback worked with Castagne v0.2, it will certainly need a second pass now that the refactoring is done.

Current version cycle is Castagne v0.6, [see the roadmap](http://panthavma.com/articles/castagne-roadmap-v1) for details.
The objective is to create all the structures needed around the game, like menus, training mode, etc.

Most of the development of Castagne will follow the development of Kronian Titans itself.
