# Advanced Guide

> In construction! Will be filled out when the project gets more stable. In the meantime, don't hesitate to ask questions on Github and Discord!

This guide covers advanced topics most users won't need to even touch.

The info covered here is only needed when you want to expand on what the engine does, for instance when you want to contribute, or when you want to make a game that's REALLY different.

<!-- This covers:
- How the internals work
- How to make new modules
- How to contribute -->

<!-- how to contribute, module dev, parser, engine loop -->
