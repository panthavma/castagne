# Castagne Editor Overview

The Castagne editor has two main parts: the configuration editor, and the character editor.
Both are available from the main menu.

## Configuration Editor
The configuration editor allows you to edit the Castagne configuration itself.

The parameters are organized per module and can be reset to their default value by pressing the reset button.

For more information on the options, please refer to the modules documentation.

You may open the editor in advanced mode to show more properties that are hidden by default.

## Character Editor
The character editor can either be opened with a registered character from the list on the right, or by making/registering a character through the `New Character` button.
