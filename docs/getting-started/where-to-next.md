# Where to next ?

Now that you have the basics of Castagne, go ahead and try to make a simple character! The main way to make it intuitive is to use it.

Here are some suggestions:
- A good way to start out is to read and **change the example characters!** You may use the [respective pages]() as references.
- If you want to **improve your skills at using Castagne**, you can check out the [Editor manual]() and the [Language Specification]()!
- If you are **not making a 2D fighter** like in the example, please read the relevant [Common Game Types]() pages to get started!
- If you want to **continue**, you may read the [Intermediate Guide]()!
- When you feel ready to **start making a game**, you can read the [Making a Game]() category!
